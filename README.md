RANDOM THOUGHTS
Goal of this project is to practice putting down Angular code and build out components.

I was recently let go from a start up due to the company restructuring.
During the short 2 months I was there, I was able to grasp the concepts and fundamentals of Angular but 
realized that I didnt have much practice throwing down code.

While working on bugfixes helped me follow the trail of logic and code and see the the different parts of the framework,
the features were mostly built out already.

Angular Material is pretty awesome for someone who is not a designer.

todo
- the db password should be in variables
- validations and error handling needs be added
